Image 5 of 5 showing our ray tracer can handle linear transformations.

This image is of the same gourd from input-23 under the same lighting.  However, this gourd has been transformed a combination of the following transformations, applied from top to bottom:
-Scale by a factor of 2 in the x-direction
-Rotate 45 degrees about the z-axis
-Translate 0.5 units down the y-axis

Time to render: 2 minutes, 49 seconds.

We are using the gourd.obj file from the following resource: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html.
