Image 4 of 5 showing our ray tracer handles reflections.

This image is of three different colored shiny spheres, centered at the same point along the z-axis, over and in front of diffuse planes.  In this example, only the planes are reflective.  The scene is under a white directional light pointing down the y- and z-axes.  The rendered image correctly shows that planes show reflections of the spheres, but the spheres do not show any reflections.

Time to render: 3 seconds.
