Image 2 of 2 showing our ray tracer handles shadows, spheres, and polygons.

This image is of three different colored shiny spheres, centered at the same point along the z-axis, over a diffuse plane.  The scene is under a white directional light pointing down the y- and z-axes.  The rendered image correctly shows shadows on the plane below the spheres that are offset according to their y-positions.

Time to render: 2 seconds.
