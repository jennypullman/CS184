Image 3 of 3 showing our ray tracer can render polygons.

This image is of a polygon shaped and colored like a gourd under a simple white directional light down the z-axis.  It shows that our ray-tracer can handle very complex obj files.

Time to render: 2 minutes, 43 seconds.

We are using the gourd.obj file from the following resource: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html.
