 1) render arbitrarily oriented ellipsoids:
	normal sphere
	ellipsoid
	rotated ellipsoid about z-axis, and translated along x-axis
2) render polygons:
	simple diamond
x	complex obj (look at examples)-->gourd.txt (and gourd.obj)
3) use simple phong shading (wouldn't this be already shown???)
	shading of sphere with different light and ambient colors
4) compute shadows
	sphere shadowing another sphere
x	sphere shadowing a square on the xz plane-->spherePlane.txt
5) compute reflections
	multiple spheres
	sphere over a plane, but with light coming in direction -1 -1 1 (i think that's the right direction)
6) apply linear transformations to objects
	obj file
	obj file translated
	obj file rotated
	obj file scaled
7) use point and directional lights
	directional light shining on sphere
	point light shining on same sphere
